# hello-world

I am a 41 year old newly divorced mother of 03 boys ages 24, 12, and 4. I was waitressing at 2 different restaurants and I was laid off recently because of covid19. I am trying to do some self employment as well as homeschooling my kids. I currently am working w instacart, uber eats, bitesquad, and postmates. It's very exhausting and I don't really do a ton of deliveries. I would love to join the bounty hunt program.
